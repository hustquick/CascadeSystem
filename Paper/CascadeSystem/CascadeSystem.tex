Different types of collectors and different technologies for electricity generation are suitable for different working temperature zones with different costs. An idea of cascade collection and cascade utilisation of solar energy with higher efficiency is presented. Parabolic trough collectors are used to collect lower temperature energy with lower cost and dish collectors are used to collect higher temperature energy with higher efficiency. Rankine cycle is used to work in lower temperature zone and Stirling cycle is used to work in higher temperature zone. Furthermore, effective topological structures are considered to take full advantages of thermodynamic characters of different components of the system. The cold chamber of Stirling engine is cooled by condensed fluid of Rankine cycle to use the heat released by Stirling engine. 

\section{System description}
An EES\nomenclature[C]{EES}{Engineering Equation Solver} model was used to study the characteristics of the cascade system. Figure~\ref{fig:System-1} shows the sketch of the cascade system. Dish collectors are used to provide heat for Stirling engines and air-to-water heat exchanger. Trough collectors are used to provide heat for preheating, evaporating and superheating in the Rankine cycle. Water is used as the working fluid of Rankine cycle, which is heated in the cold chamber of Stirling engines, preheater, evaporator, superheater, and air-to-water heat exchanger successively, and then expand in turbine, condense in condenser. Pumps are used to change the pressure of fluids. Stirling engines are used for power generation and cooled by feed water of the Rankine cycle. State number pairs of different fluids are marked on the sketch. The first number of a number pair indicates the fluid type, the second number of a number pair indicates the state point of the fluid. Number pairs with solid circle indicate saturated liquid states ($x$\nomenclature{$x$}{Dryness fraction} = 0), and with dotted circle indicates saturated gas states ($x$ = 1).

To build the cascade system model, several simplifying assumptions are made:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Steady state at nominal load of the system is analyzed
	\item Pressure drop due to flow is negligible everywhere
	\item Same isentropic efficiency of steam turbine with different loads and in different stages
	\item There is no heat loss to the environment for Stirling engines
	\item Simple models are used of some processes and equipments
	\item A symmetrical regenerator behaviour is assumed so that a single effectiveness can be defined as $e=\dfrac{T_R - T_L}{T_H - T_L}$\cite{Formosa2010, Albert2010}
	\item There is no heat loss to the environment for Stirling engines
\end{itemize}

\section{System model}
The system is built in several blocks. These blocks are made of circuits and efficiency calculations. Two circuits, air circuit and water circuit, are built in some specific states and in some components. Known parameters of the states, we can get the efficiency of the system and the overall efficiency of separated systems.

\subsection{Air circuit}
In air circuit, efficiency of dish collectors needs to be calculated. Fraser, in his dissertation\cite{Fraser2008}, built a performance prediction model of Stirling dish system, which has detailed description of the dish collector model. The model is also used in the software SAM\nomenclature[C]{SAM}{System Advisor Model}, which provides performance and financial models for facilitate decision in the renewable energy industry.

In our cascade system, the structure of the dish receiver is as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dishReceiver}. The dish receiver model concerns the losses includes: collector losses due to mirror reflectivity, receiver intercept losses, losses due to shading, and thermal losses. Thermal losses take the largest portion of all those losses, which are due to conduction, convection and radiation. Figure~\ref{fig:thermal-lose} shows the heat network of dish receiver, which concerns the losses:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Radiation losses reflected off of the receiver cavity surfaces and out of the receiver through the aperture. ($q_{rad,reflect}$)
	\item Conductive losses through the receiver insulating layer. ($q_{cond,tot}$)
	\item Free convection from the cavity in the absence of wind. ($q_{conv,free}$)
	\item Forced convection in the presence of wind. ($q_{conv,forced}$)
	\item Emission losses due to thermal radiation emitted from the receiver aperture. ($q_{rad,emit}$)
\end{itemize}

	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{graphics/dishReceiver}
	\caption{Structure of the dish receiver}
	\label{fig:dishReceiver}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reflected loss of dish receiver}
To determine the reflected loss of the cavity surfaces of the dish receiver, the effective absorptance of the cavity receiver $\alpha_{eff}$\nomenclature[G]{$\alpha_{eff}$}{Effective absorptance} is required to determine the fraction of energy reflected out of the receiver. The effective absorptance of a cavity receiver without a receiver aperture cover is given by Equation~(\ref{eq:alpha_eff}) where $\alpha_{cav}$ is the cavity surface absrptance, $A_a$ is the cavity aperture area, and $A_{cav}$ is the total inner surface area of the cavity \cite{Duffie2006}.

\begin{equation}
	\alpha_{eff}=\dfrac{\alpha_{cav}}{\alpha_{cav}+\left(1-\alpha_{cav}\right)\left(A_{ap}/A_{cav}\right)}
	\label{eq:alpha_eff}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Conduction loss of dish receiver}

\subsubsection{Convection loss of dish receiver}
Ma conducted tests to determine the free convection losses from the receiver for six alternative setups, and the data were consistent with Stine and McDonald's free convection correlation\cite{Ma1993}. It is assumed that forced convection is independent of free convection in the receiver, so the total convection losses can be represented as the sum of the free and forced convection losses as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thermal-lose}.

\begin{equation}
	q_{con,tot} = q_{con,free} + q_{con,forced}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
q_{in}\nomenclature{$q_{in}$}{Solar energy launched into dish receiver aperture, W} = q_{rad,reflect}\nomenclature{$q_{rad,reflect}$}{Reflected radiation}+q_{dish,air}\nomenclature{$q_{dish,air}$}{Energy absorbed by air in the dish collector}+(q_{cond,tot}\nomenclature{$q_{cond,tot}$}{Total conduction loss}+q_{conv,tot}\nomenclature{$q_{conv,tot}$}{Total convection loss}+q_{rad,emit}\nomenclature{$q_{rad,emit}$}{Radiation emitted by dish receiver})\label{eq:q_in sum}
\end{equation}
