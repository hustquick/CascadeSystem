@article{Ghaem2012,
	Abstract = {Small-scale recuperated gas turbines with a highly efficient recuperator would appear to have considerable potential to be used in solar/fossil-fuel hybrid dish systems. The hybrid solar gas turbine can be configured in several different fashions, with the key difference being the relative positions of the solar receiver and burner as well as the operation mode of the burner. Steady state and transient models have been implemented in Engineering Equation Solver and the performance of various configurations are studied and compared. Layouts in which the receiver is located before the turbine (pressurized receivers) demonstrate higher performance compared to the one in which the receiver is located after the turbine (atmospheric receivers). The variation in operation throughout the year is taken into account and the performance of the system analyzed for two different cities (Yechang in China and Bechar in Algeria, with low and high solar insolation respectively). The integration of a solar receiver into a micro gas turbine reduces the yearly fuel consumption by around 15-16{\%} in Yechang and up to 40{\%} in Bechar. This will result in reductions of CO2 emissions as well as leading to lower daily operating costs. The hybrid nature of the Dish-Brayton system guarantees availability of the engine to meet the electricity demand whenever it occurs, allowing the system to supply dispatchable power.},

@article{Franchini2013,
	Abstract = {Simulations were carried out to predict the performance of a Solar Rankine Cycle (SRC) and an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) when combined with two different solar field configurations based on parabolic trough and power tower systems. For the selected cases, yearly plant performance was computed under real operating conditions on a one hour basis. A computing procedure was developed by integrating two commercial softwares with in-house computer code. Thermodynamic performance was featured for every plant configuration both at nominal and part load conditions. A single reheat regenerative Rankine cycle was chosen for the SRC plant whereas a commercial gas turbine, i.e. Siemens SGT-800, with a dual pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) was assumed for the ISCC plant. As far as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is concerned, molten salt was chosen to transfer heat to the water loop in the SRC. Synthetic oil was considered in the ISCC plant. Plants were assumed to be located in a Southern Spain site.The comparative analysis was mainly focused on the influence of CSP technology on global solar energy conversion efficiency of both SRC and ISCC plants. Special attention was devoted to assess trough collectors (PTCs) against the solar tower (ST) system in terms of intercepted radiation and thermal power sent to the power block. The ISCC coupled with a ST was found to assure the highest annual solar-to-electric efficiency of 21.8{\%}. This is the result of both higher collection efficiency of ST compared to PTCs and higher conversion efficiency of solar energy introduced into the combined cycle, as compared to SRC. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@inproceedings{Cipollone2014,
	Abstract = {One of the most important challenges facing our future is the balance between energy needs and production, in the framework of the CO2 commitments almost universally adopted. The total energy consumption is still a prerogative of fossil fuels, with a share close to 90 {\%}, [1]; renewable energy, apart from the energy production from hydro, photovoltaic, biomass, waste and others, counts 3-4 {\%} since many years ago. This discouraging result calls for new conversion technologies based on renewables, if the concept of sustainability is really adopted. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants technology could make the difference with respect to the other renewable technologies, thanks to "hybridity" in combining the concentrated solar energy source and the conventional power generation (actually steam turbine plants as energy conversion section). In the sector of energy production, parabolic trough (PT) type is more promising. Recently, the Authors showed in [2, 3] how convenient could be the utilization of gases as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) with advantages from a technological point of view in the heat collector section and, mainly, from the conversion section point of view, having the possibility to use gas turbines in which the HTF directly expands. In this work, the Authors discuss some thermodynamic and engineering aspects concerning the use of gases as HTF, limiting the attention to air and CO 2 and they further discuss the performances of an innovative gas turbine power plant. It is based on a sequence of compressions and expansions, intercooled and reheated (inside linear solar receivers) respectively, in order to increase cycle specific work and efficiency. The paper focuses the attention on the optimum number of compressions and expansions: when it changes, pressure levels change too, requiring a series of reheating processes which operate in parallel, so increasing the overall solar receiver length and, definitively, investment costs. The optimization has been done adopting as design parameter the power per unit of collector length [kW/m], which is the most sensible parameter defining investment cost. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

	Abstract = {Molten salt technology represents nowadays the most cost-effective technology for electricity generation for solar power plant. 0D/1D models are useful to check, validate and improve through simulation the energy performances of existing power plants. They are also used to find the best design that meets required economical criteria and the preparation of the acceptance test for commissioning of the power plant. A dynamic multi-configuration model of a concentrated solar power plant has been developed. The component model is meant to be used for power plant modeling with the ThermoSysPro library developed by EDF and released under open source license. The model is based on momentum and mass/energy conservation equations, as 1-dimensionnal (1D), partial differential equations. The model includes a water/steam cycle (economizer, evaporator, superheater, turbines, aerocondenser, water heaters, pumps, valves, tank, volumes and pipes), molten salt thermal storage system (temperature up to 565$\,^{\circ}$C with a capacity of 8 hours of electricity production without sunlight) and a cylindrical receiver. The distribution of the heat flux received by the receiver may be calculated by Tonatiuh tool (Ray Tracing tool). The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate the capability of said model to simulate the operating conditions of a solar power plant, and then the capability of the model to check the manufacturers design and targeted performances. In order to be able to answer to many different situations, we created some variables in some of the component model enabling to switch itself on or off. So (turbine stage, water heater, ...), the same model can simulate several different plant configurations. This model (Modelica model, translate with Dymola) includes all typical configurations, thus enabling its use through a user-friendly Excel interface. With this interface, comparisons between various architectures according to given criteria and constraints are easy, thus helping the user to define the best design. This interface can be used by a non-specialist in modeling. Several transients are simulated, the objectives are: check the performances and the design (sizing of the components) given by the manufacturers, verify and validate by simulation the scenario of large transients and to reduce the uncertainty of the prediction on the yearly electricity production (simulation with yearly DNI).},

@article{Cau2014,
	Abstract = {This paper compares the performance of medium-size Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants based on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power generation unit integrated with parabolic trough and linear Fresnel collectors. The CSP plants studied herein use thermal oil as heat transfer fluid and as storage medium in a two-tank direct thermal storage system. The performance of the CSP plants were evaluated on the basis of a 1 MW ORC unit with a conversio n efficiency of about 24{\%} and by considering different values of solar mult iple and thermal storage capacity. The comparative performance analysis of the two CSP solutions was carried out with reference to the direct solar energy availability of Cagliari, Italy (1720 kWh/m2y) on a yearly basis by means of specifically developed simulation models. The results of the performance assessment demonstrate that CSP plants based on linear Fresnel collectors lead to higher values of electrical energy production per unit area of occupied land. The highest specific energy production of CSP plants based on linear Fresnel collectors is about 55-60 kWh/y per m2 of occupied land and it is achieved with solar multiples in the 1.74-2.5 range and storage capacities in the range of 4-12 hours. The highest specific production of the solutions based on parabolic trough collectors is about 45-50 kWh/y per m2 of occupied land and is achieved with lower solar multiples (around 1.5-2.3). Owing to their better optical efficiency, the use of parabolic troughs gives better values of energy production per unit area of solar collector (about 180-190 kWh/m2 vs. 130-140 kWh/m2). ?? 2013 The Authors.},

In support of these efforts, the AEETES thermal performance numerical model has been developed to predict thermal performance of pool-boiler and heat-pipe reflux receivers. The formulation of the AEETES numerical model, which is applicable to axisymmetric geometries with asymmetric incident fluxes, is presented in detail. Thermal efficiency predictions agree to within 4.1{\%} with test data from on-sun tests of a pool-boiler reflux receiver. Predicted absorber and sidewall temperatures agree with thermocouple data to within 3.3 and 7.3{\%}, respectively. The importance of accounting for the asymmetric incident fluxes is demonstrated in comparisons with predictions using azimuthally averaged variables. The predicted receiver heat losses are characterized in terms of convective, solar radiative, and infrared radiative, and conductive heat transfer mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a parabolic dish/AMTEC solar thermal power system and evaluates its overall thermal--electric conversion performance. The system is a combined system in which a parabolic dish solar collector is cascaded with an alkali metal thermal to electric converter (AMTEC) through a coupling heat exchanger. A separate type heat-pipe receiver is selected to isothermally transfer the solar energy from the collector to the AMTEC. To assess the system's overall thermal--electric conversion performance, a theoretical analysis has been undertaken in conjunction with a parametric investigation by varying relevant parameters, i.e., the average operating temperature and performance parameters associate with the dish collector and the AMTEC. Results show that the overall conversion efficiency of parabolic dish/AMTEC system could reach up to 20.6{\%} with a power output of 18.54kW corresponding to an operating temperature of 1280K. Moreover, it is found that the optimal condenser temperature, corresponding to the maximum overall efficiency, is around 600K. This study indicates that the parabolic dish/AMTEC solar power system exhibits a great potential and competitiveness over other solar dish/engine systems, and the proposed system is a viable solar thermal power system.},

	Abstract = {From Indian perspective there is a large potential available for low cost solar water heating systems. The described system can instantly fulfil needs of hot water in industrial sector. This type of system can be used for heating boiler feed water, laundry applications and other steam generation applications. In general, concentrated solar collectors have high efficiency as compared to flat plate and evacuated tube solar collectors. Therefore, for water heating application, high efficiency can be achieved. Authors used parabolic dish collector for instant water heating application. This paper reveals prototype design of solar parabolic dish collector with truncated cone shaped helical coiled receiver made up of copper and coated with nickel chrome at focal point. Instantaneous efficiency of 63.9{\%} has been achieved with the system explained in this paper. This prototype has been evaluated for its performance during month of April and May 2010 at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India [Latitude: 16.42$\,^{\circ}$ North, Longitude: 74.13$\,^{\circ}$ West].
