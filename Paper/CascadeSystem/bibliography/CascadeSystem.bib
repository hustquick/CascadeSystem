@article{Wu2010a,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a parabolic dish/AMTEC solar thermal power system and evaluates its overall thermal--electric conversion performance. The system is a combined system in which a parabolic dish solar collector is cascaded with an alkali metal thermal to electric converter (AMTEC) through a coupling heat exchanger. A separate type heat-pipe receiver is selected to isothermally transfer the solar energy from the collector to the AMTEC. To assess the system's overall thermal--electric conversion performance, a theoretical analysis has been undertaken in conjunction with a parametric investigation by varying relevant parameters, i.e., the average operating temperature and performance parameters associate with the dish collector and the AMTEC. Results show that the overall conversion efficiency of parabolic dish/AMTEC system could reach up to 20.6{\%} with a power output of 18.54kW corresponding to an operating temperature of 1280K. Moreover, it is found that the optimal condenser temperature, corresponding to the maximum overall efficiency, is around 600K. This study indicates that the parabolic dish/AMTEC solar power system exhibits a great potential and competitiveness over other solar dish/engine systems, and the proposed system is a viable solar thermal power system.},

@article{Sagade2012a,
	Abstract = {From Indian perspective there is a large potential available for low cost solar water heating systems. The described system can instantly fulfil needs of hot water in industrial sector. This type of system can be used for heating boiler feed water, laundry applications and other steam generation applications. In general, concentrated solar collectors have high efficiency as compared to flat plate and evacuated tube solar collectors. Therefore, for water heating application, high efficiency can be achieved. Authors used parabolic dish collector for instant water heating application. This paper reveals prototype design of solar parabolic dish collector with truncated cone shaped helical coiled receiver made up of copper and coated with nickel chrome at focal point. Instantaneous efficiency of 63.9{\%} has been achieved with the system explained in this paper. This prototype has been evaluated for its performance during month of April and May 2010 at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India [Latitude: 16.42$\,^{\circ}$ North, Longitude: 74.13$\,^{\circ}$ West].
