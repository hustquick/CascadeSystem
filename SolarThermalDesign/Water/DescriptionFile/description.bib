@article{Hogan1994,
	Abstract = {Reflux solar receivers for dish-Stirling electric power generation systems are currently being investigated by several companies and laboratories. In support of these efforts, the AEETES thermal performance numerical model has been developed to predict thermal performance of pool-boiler and heat-pipe reflux receivers. The formulation of the AEETES numerical model, which is applicable to axisymmetric geometries with asymmetric incident fluxes, is presented in detail. Thermal efficiency predictions agree to within 4.1{\%} with test data from on-sun tests of a pool-boiler reflux receiver. Predicted absorber and sidewall temperatures agree with thermocouple data to within 3.3 and 7.3{\%}, respectively. The importance of accounting for the asymmetric incident fluxes is demonstrated in comparisons with predictions using azimuthally averaged variables. The predicted receiver heat losses are characterized in terms of convective, solar radiative, and infrared radiative, and conductive heat transfer mechanisms.},

Solar technologies already provide energy for heat, light, hot water, electricity, and cooling for homes, businesses, and industry. Because solar energy only accounts for one-tenth of a percent of primary energy demand, relatively small increases in market penetration can lead to very rapid growth rates in the industry{\^{a}}which is exactly what has been projected for coming years as the world moves away from carbon-based energy production.

@article{Formosa2010,
	Abstract = {In order to study further the promising free piston Stirling engine architecture, there is a need of an analytical thermodynamic model which could be used in a dynamical analysis for preliminary design. To aim at more realistic values, the models have to take into account the heat losses and irreversibilities on the engine. An analytical model which encompasses the critical flaws of the regenerator and furthermore the heat exchangers effectivenesses has been developed. This model has been validated using the whole range of the experimental data available from the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype. The effects of the technological and operating parameters on Stirling engine performance have been investigated. In addition to the regenerator influence, the effect of the cooler effectiveness is underlined. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wu2010a,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a parabolic dish/AMTEC solar thermal power system and evaluates its overall thermal--electric conversion performance. The system is a combined system in which a parabolic dish solar collector is cascaded with an alkali metal thermal to electric converter (AMTEC) through a coupling heat exchanger. A separate type heat-pipe receiver is selected to isothermally transfer the solar energy from the collector to the AMTEC. To assess the system's overall thermal--electric conversion performance, a theoretical analysis has been undertaken in conjunction with a parametric investigation by varying relevant parameters, i.e., the average operating temperature and performance parameters associate with the dish collector and the AMTEC. Results show that the overall conversion efficiency of parabolic dish/AMTEC system could reach up to 20.6{\%} with a power output of 18.54kW corresponding to an operating temperature of 1280K. Moreover, it is found that the optimal condenser temperature, corresponding to the maximum overall efficiency, is around 600K. This study indicates that the parabolic dish/AMTEC solar power system exhibits a great potential and competitiveness over other solar dish/engine systems, and the proposed system is a viable solar thermal power system.},

	Abstract = {From Indian perspective there is a large potential available for low cost solar water heating systems. The described system can instantly fulfil needs of hot water in industrial sector. This type of system can be used for heating boiler feed water, laundry applications and other steam generation applications. In general, concentrated solar collectors have high efficiency as compared to flat plate and evacuated tube solar collectors. Therefore, for water heating application, high efficiency can be achieved. Authors used parabolic dish collector for instant water heating application. This paper reveals prototype design of solar parabolic dish collector with truncated cone shaped helical coiled receiver made up of copper and coated with nickel chrome at focal point. Instantaneous efficiency of 63.9{\%} has been achieved with the system explained in this paper. This prototype has been evaluated for its performance during month of April and May 2010 at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India [Latitude: 16.42$\,^{\circ}$ North, Longitude: 74.13$\,^{\circ}$ West].
